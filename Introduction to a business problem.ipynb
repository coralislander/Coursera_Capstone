    "A strategic city planning is of benefit to a state government to improve citizens' economic and living levels. To this end, a better understanding to the cities in a state is of importance. In this project we will cluster and  evaluate the cities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany based on the fields in working, education, living facilities, transportation, health care and leisure places. By this way, we can find out the top cities in each field as well as the bottom cities that to be improved in the corresponding field. Moreover, we can reveal the correlations among cities based on the above-mentioned fields and figure out how a city's change impacts on the correlated cities. The correlations among cities will facilicate the development of multiple cities synchronously and therefore is useful to be applied to a city planning. \n",

    "To simplify the issue, we focus on the frequency of appearance of categorized buildings as an index to estimate the level of the development in each city field. By $k$-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, we classify the cities in five clusters. For each cluster, a correlation pattern among different city fields is disclosed. To give a recommandation for travelling or a suggestion for city planning, we rank the five top and bottom cities in each field. \n",

    "This project report is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the dataset we used and the processing for dealing with the raw data. In section 3, we classify the cities with the methods of $k$-means clustering and hierarchical clustering and then visualize the city clusters. In section 4, we analyze and discuss the characteristics of city clusters and select out the best and the worst cities in each field. We finally conclude our results in section 5.\n",
